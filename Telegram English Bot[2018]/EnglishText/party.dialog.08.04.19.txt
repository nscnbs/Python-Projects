A: Today we will discuss about our party.
B: Oh, fine, I like it. When it will be?
A: The party start at 6 o'clock in the evening on Sunday. Do you have any suggestion?
B: Yeah! First of all we need to get up all convenient at the party. Where the party will be?
A: I will give you a surprise. I found an abandoned depot.
B: Oh, that's great, it is worth. There is plenty of space and we can think of a lot of things.
A: Sure! We can make a little show for children. I can perform as Shrek.
B: We can play a small litter between Shrek and Donkey, cause this is the leading parts. It will amuse them.
A: Yeah, we can do this. Do you want to perform as Donkey?
B: No, I refuse, but I can try to convince Charlie to perform.
A: I know him well, he hasn't the courage, but make an attempt then.
B: We will see. What else will we do?
A: Do you remember our last party? Perhaps, we can make use of almost everything that was there.
B: Sure! We will put slot machines, artificial houses in which children can play and everyone will be happy.
A: That sounds great, I look forward to this party. We recover all our investments.
B: Don't say these words please, but we can really do it.
