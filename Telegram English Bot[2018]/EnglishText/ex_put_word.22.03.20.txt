Would you like to change your face and body Would you like movie star looks A lot of people think about this. They are ready to spend a lot of money to go to a cosmetic surgeon and change their appearance. The most common operation we call foolish desires. People who are unhappy with their nose have it reshaped. Other people want their age spots to disappear to make themselves look younger. People also go crazy and have things made bigger or smaller. I think this a nonsense. I'm not the best-looking person in the world but I would never consider plastic surgery - even if it was free. Some people have so many operations they end up looking like they're made of plastic. I'd prefer the nature looking human.
