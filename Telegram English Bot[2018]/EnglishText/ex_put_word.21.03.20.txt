People say that beauty is on the mind of the beholder. That means if someone thinks someone else is beautiful, then he is really beautiful. I think the idea of beauty is interesting. Why do we consider some things or some people are beautiful and other aren’t. Some people think a building is beautiful, but other think the opposite. People nowadays spend a lot of time and money on beauty. I agree with the expression, “beauty is only skin deep”. This means that inner beauty really important is someone’s heart and character, not what they look like on the outside. It’s a little strange and unfair, that you have to be beautiful to be a top actress of a film or the news reader on TV. I think there should be a chance for most of us “non-beautiful” people.
