A lilac bush
Nikolay Evgrafovich Almazov, without taking off his coat, he came to his office. The wife, seeing his grim face, realized, that something terrible had happened. She silently went following by her husband to talk with him one by one.
Almazov, a poor young officer, listened a lecture at the General Staff Academy and he have just returned from there. He was able(succeeded) to pass all exams, except the last. It’s was terrible. Only Almazov and his wife knew how difficult it was for him to enter the Academy. Almazov failed the entrance exams twice. If not for his wife, he would have given up the idea to try a third time a long time ago, but Vera always encouraged him and never refused to help him. Last year, he finally succeed to enter the Academy, but now ...
A few minutes Almazov sat silently on the sofa staring at his own shadow. Vera spoke first.
- Kolya, how is your work Unsuccessful
- Well, yes, bad luck. And all because of the stain.
- What a stain, dear Be kind, explain, that beats me. 
- You see, when I was working on the plan, I was deadly tired, my hands began to tremble, and I put a green spot on the plan. The work was flawed. What should I have done(was supposed to do) I decided to turn this spot into bushes. And today, when I showed my work to a professor, he asked me “Are there really bushes”. Sure, it would be better if I told him the truth. But I began to insist. The professor got angry and said “Then we will go to this place tomorrow and then we will see that you either negligently worked or copied the plan from the map without leaving your own home”.
 - But maybe the professor is mistaken, are there bushes We can find out, right
-  No point(It’s useless). He knows this area better than his bedroom. Oh, how I hate him!
- But Kolya, time is not waiting(we haven’t time)”, - said Verachka.“ It’s too late now, your professor, of course, is sleeping. I think we will not meet him on the street. Here we must take advantage of this.
The husband stared at her, not understanding anything, but she had already put on her coat and hat…” If there are no bushes, they should be planted immediately, - she told.
When she arrived to the florist, it was too late. The old florist was very amazed and displeased. Talk a little Vera decided to be frank with the old man. When she was beginning to lose hope of convincing him, he suddenly said “I have two lilac bushes. If I were you, I would use them”.
The next day seemed to Vera very long. She was looking forward to her husband come.
She realized that everything was fine, finally seeing his tired but happy face.
- Well, we came to these bushes ... – he began to talk - the professor could not believe his own eyes. He offered me his hand and said “Sorry i'm getting older”. What a cute and intelligent man! He is so respected by everyone in the Academy. Really, I am ashamed that I had cheated him! ..
Nikolai Evgrafovich had never enjoyed his lunch with such pleasure as he did that day. After lunch, when Vera brought Almazov a glass of tea in her office, husband and wife suddenly laughed at the same time, looked at each other, and Vera said Now the lilac will be forever my favorite flower ...
